# Deep_learning_CNN_MNIST
Convolutional neural net using keras and tensorflow

Various implementations of a CNN to recognize digits on a MNIST dataset are shown here. The best working code in a 2D CNN implemented using Keras. Wroks really well.

The training and testing data is avaliable on Kaggle. Currently working on modifying the CNN to achieve higher scores on Kaggle.
